## phd-thesis
This is code accompanying my phd thesis, and should be read in tandem with it

Chapter 2: iMagma notebook constructing Chayet-Garibaldi algebras of type $G_2$ using octonions

Chapter 5: Jupyter notebook (SageMath) constructing Chayet-Garibaldi algebras of type $E_7$ using Brown algebras, used to verifyi some identities in Chapter 5

Chapter 6: Magma script based off the code from "A class of continuous non-associative algebras arising from algebraic groups including $E_8$" that computes fusion laws for the idempotents $u_\alpha$. We've also added the data for different types

Chapter 8: Magma script to compute the dimension of the Lie algebra of derivations of a given Matsuo algebra.

Chapter 9: Jupyter notebooks (SageMath) to construct the algebras from Construction 9.5.1 and Remark 9.5.6(iii), and then verify that they are axial.

Further-research: - Magma script to compute fusion laws for Chayet's idempotents in split Chayet-Garibaldi algebras
                  - iMagma notebook to compute the signature of $f$ for the compact real Chayet-Garibaldi algebra of type $G_2$
