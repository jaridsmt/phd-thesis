## File overview

main.magma - Magma script written by Chayet and Garibaldi to construct the Chayet--Garibaldi algebras for split simple algebraic groups.

generic-routines.magma - Magma script written by Chayet and Garibaldi in support of main.magma.

randelt.magma - Magma script written by Chayet and Garibaldi in support of main.magma.

dual-coxeter.magma - Magma script written by Chayet and Garibaldi in support of main.magma.

fusionlaw.magma - Magma script to compute the fusion law of an idempotent.

chayetidemp.magma - Magma script to compute the fusion law of the idempotent $e_{\tilde{\alpha},\tilde{\beta}}(1)$, where $\tilde{\alpha}$ is the highest root, and $\tilde{\beta}$ the highest root that is orthogonal to $\tilde{\alpha}$. The data outputted is written into a file called "ChayetIdem[KC].txt", where KC is the type of the Chayet--Garibaldi algebra.

chayetidempsingular.magma - Magma script to compute the fusion law of the idempotents corresponding to the $A_1$ component of the orthogonal root system in Chayet--Garibaldi algebras of type $B_n$ and $D_n$. The data outputted is written into a file called "ChayetIdemsingular[KC].txt", where KC is the type of the Chayet--Garibaldi algebra.

Ag2-Norton-ineq - iMagma notebook to compute the norton quadratic form on $\bigwedge^2 A$, where $A$ is the compact real Chayet--Garibaldi algebra of type $G_2$.
