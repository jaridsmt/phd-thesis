## File overview

4trans_axial_algebra.m - Includes various standard functions, such as checking if a polycyclic group is an N-transposition group, constructing the "universal" axial algebra of Jordan type for a $4$-transposition group, constructing the $3$-transposition group by extending a Weyl group with the root lattice, etc.

check-axial.m - magma code to check whether the standard basis of an algebra $A$ is a basis of Jordan type axes.

derivationsofmatsuo.m - magma code to compute the dimension of the derivation algebra of Matsuo algebras.
